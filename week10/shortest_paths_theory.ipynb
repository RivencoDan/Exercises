    "A **Shortest Path** in a graph is the path between two vertices such that the sum of the edge weights is minimized. The **shortest path tree** is a spanning tree where each vertex is reached by the shortest possible path from the root.\n",

    "### Algorithms to Find Shortest Paths:\n",
    "- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Solves the shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handles graphs with negative edge weights, and can detect negative weight cycles.\n",
    "- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Solves the all-pairs shortest path problem.\n",
    "- **A* Algorithm**: An extension of Dijkstra’s that uses heuristics to optimize pathfinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Shortest Paths:\n",
    "- **Negative Weights**: Dijkstra's algorithm does not work for graphs with negative edge weights. The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative weights but cannot handle negative weight cycles.\n",
    "- **Shortest Path Tree**: The shortest path tree from a source node contains the shortest paths from the source to every other node in the graph.\n"
