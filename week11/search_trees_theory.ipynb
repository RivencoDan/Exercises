    "## Theory of Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A **search tree** is a tree data structure that allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. Common types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree where for each node, the left child contains values smaller than the node, and the right child contains values greater than the node.\n",
    "- **2-3 Tree**: A balanced search tree where each node has either two or three children and maintains balance automatically during insertions and deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties:\n",
    "- Each node has a key greater than the keys in its left subtree and smaller than the keys in its right subtree.\n",
    "- Searching, insertion, and deletion operations can be done in O(log n) time on average, assuming the tree is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-3 Tree Properties:\n",
    "- Each internal node has 2 or 3 children, and all leaves are at the same depth.\n",
    "- The height of a 2-3 tree is guaranteed to be O(log n), ensuring balanced performance for queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Search Trees:\n",
    "- **Predecessor**: The predecessor of a node is the largest node in the left subtree or the highest ancestor whose right child is also an ancestor of the node.\n",
    "- **Range Query**: Returns all elements in a specified range.\n",
    "- **Range Count**: Counts the number of elements within a specified range.\n",
