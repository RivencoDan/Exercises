    "## Theory of Minimum Spanning Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree that has the minimum possible total edge weight. A spanning tree is a subset of the edges that connect all vertices together, without any cycles, and a minimum spanning tree is the one with the smallest total weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of MSTs\n",
    "- **Uniqueness of MST**: If all edge weights in the graph are distinct, then the MST is unique.\n",
    "- **Lightest Edge**: The lightest edge crossing any cut in a graph must be part of the MST.\n",
    "- **Heaviest Edge**: The heaviest edge in a cycle cannot be part of the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms to Find MST\n",
    "- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Builds the MST by sorting all edges in increasing order of their weights and adding edges to the MST in order, while avoiding cycles.\n",
    "- **Prim's Algorithm**: Starts with an arbitrary node and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to one outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reverse Deletion Algorithm\n",
    "This is a bottom-up approach where you start with a full graph and remove edges one by one in decreasing order of weight. If removing an edge disconnects the graph, it is kept; otherwise, it is removed.\n",
